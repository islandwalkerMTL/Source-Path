function [dist] = distancePointToEllipse(X,Y,ra,rb,xc,yc,phi,accuracy)
%Find the distance between one or more points and an ellipse
%X and Y are the coordinates of the point(s) under consideration. X and Y may be
%vectors representing lists of point ordinates.
%xc is the ellipse centre x ordinate, yc is the y centre ordinate, ra is the semi-major axis length
%rb is the semi-minor axis length, phi is the orientation of the ellipse major axis with respect to
%the x axis (in radians).
%xc, yc, phi and accuracy are optional and optionally empty, if not given the ellipse will be centred
%at the origin and have an orientation of zero. The accuracy defaults to 10^-6.
%This function is dumb. It simply finds a minimum by evaluating the funtion at lots of
%positions and taking the lowest, then searching again until the desired accuracy is reached.
%However it is evaluated quickly enough so that the user is
%unlikely to notice the poor performance unless calculating distance for millions of points.
%accuracy is the parameter that decides how close the distance can be from the true distance
%and it cannot be set lower than 10^-6.
%A gradient descent method would be faster, but I don't have time to implement it as of writing.
